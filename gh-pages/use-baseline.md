# Use Baseline in your project

There are many ways to use Baseline in your projects today.

## Determine when a feature is ready to use

When visiting sites like [Can I Use](https://caniuse.com), [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/), [RUM Archive Insights](https://rumarchive.com/insights/#baseline) and [webstatus.dev](https://webstatus.dev), check the status of a feature to learn if it works across browsers.

## Let others know when a feature works across browsers

Writing a blog post or article? Or presenting at a conference? Use the [Baseline logos](name-and-logo-usage-guidelines) as a shorthand to let your audience know the status of a feature.

The [Universal Baseline Widget](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/baseline-status) is also available to include on your site or pages to indicate the status of a web feature. It renders at run-time, so itâ€™s always up to date with the latest Baseline status.

## Looking forward

This is just the start. More tools are coming to help you use Baseline in your day to day workflow. For example, linters that alert you if you use features not supported in your browser support matrix, and tooling to help you discover new useful Baseline features.
