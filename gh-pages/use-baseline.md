# Use Baseline in your project

You can use Baseline to:

- Make decisions about what web platform features to use in your sites and applications
- Tell others whether features work across browsers

## Check if a feature works across browsers

When visiting sites like [Can I Use](https://caniuse.com), [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/), [RUM Archive Insights](https://rumarchive.com/insights/#baseline) and [webstatus.dev](https://webstatus.dev), check the status of a feature to learn if it works across browsers.

## Let others know when a feature works across browsers

Are you writing a blog post or article or presenting at a conference? Use the [Baseline logos](name-and-logo-usage-guidelines) as a shorthand to let your audience know the status of a feature.

The [`<baseline-status>` web component](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/baseline-status) is also available to include on your site or pages to indicate the status of a web feature. It renders at run-time, so itâ€™s always up to date with the latest Baseline status.
