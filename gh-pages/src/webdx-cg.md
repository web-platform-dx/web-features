> The mission of the [Web Developer Experience (WebDX) Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/webdx/) is to facilitate coordinated approaches to improve the overall experience of developing for the Web platform when such coordination provides unique opportunities for these improvements. â€” [WebDX Community Group charter](https://github.com/web-platform-dx/admin/blob/main/charter.md).

The web-features project grew out of the work of the WebDX Community Group. WebDX plays an important part in coordinating the web-features project by hosting meetings and making connections to research, standardization work, and other efforts.

## Get involved

As a W3C community group, anyone can become involved in the work of the WebDX Community Group, by [joining through the W3C](https://www.w3.org/community/webdx/join). This is how to take a more active role in Baseline, or in other web developer experience initiatives. If you work for a company that is a W3C member, your membership needs to be approved by your representative, otherwise you can join as an individual.
