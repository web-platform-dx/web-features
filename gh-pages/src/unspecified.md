title: Unspecified web platform features

Some browsers implement additions to HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and web APIs that are not part of any known web platform specification, past or present, such as the specifications published by the [W3C](https://www.w3.org/standards/), [TC39](https://tc39.es/), or [WHATWG](https://whatwg.org/). Typically, these are historic additions, retained for backwards compatibility.

**If you're a web developer, think carefully before relying on these features.** They usually have poor cross-browser support, surprising behaviors, and limited documentation.

Since these additions are unspecified and rarely supported across browsers, web-features reports these additions as having limited availability. Also, web-features deems the features as [discouraged](https://github.com/web-platform-dx/web-features/blob/main/docs/guidelines.md#discouraged) by omission from relevant specifications.

If you're a browser implementer or specification editor and you think a feature has been marked as unspecified in error, [file an issue on web-platform-dx/web-features](https://github.com/web-platform-dx/web-features/issues).
