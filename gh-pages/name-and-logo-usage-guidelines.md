# Baseline name and logo usage guidelines

[Web Platform Baseline](./) is an initiative that gives you clear information about which web platform features are ready to use in your projects today. When reading an article, or choosing a library for your project, if the features used are all part of Baseline, you can trust the level of browser compatibility.

The Baseline name and logos (“Baseline Trademarks”) are trademarks owned by Google, but have been licensed so they can be used by third parties to indicate which web platform features work well across all browsers. We've put together these guidelines to promote the growth of the Baseline initiative while making sure that the “Baseline” brand is protected as a meaningful source identifier in a way that’s consistent with trademark law.

We encourage you to use the Baseline name and logos in articles, presentations, sites, or anywhere that you’re talking about web platform features, to help developers understand browser support for those features.

## Trademark Usage Guidelines

- The Baseline Trademarks should not be used or registered in a manner that would cause confusion as to Google’s sponsorship, affiliation, or endorsement.
- The Baseline Trademarks should not be combined with other trademarks, terms, or source identifiers.
- Don't modify, distort or alter the Baseline Trademarks. That includes modifying the Baseline name (for example, through hyphenation, combination or abbreviation), or displaying the Baseline logos with color variations or unapproved visual elements.

      <a href="assets/img/baseline-widely-word-dark.svg" download>Download SVG</a>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

The Baseline Widely Available logo should be used when talking about Baseline as a concept, or to indicate a specific web platform feature has been supported by all of the core browsers for at least 30 months, and is therefore widely interoperable.

### Baseline Newly Available logo

<table class="logos">
  <tr>
    <td>
      <img src="assets/img/baseline-newly-icon.svg" alt="Baseline newly available icon"><br>
      <a href="assets/img/baseline-newly-icon.png" download>Download PNG</a> |
      <a href="assets/img/baseline-newly-icon.svg" download>Download SVG</a>
    </td>
    <td>
      <img src="assets/img/baseline-newly-icon-dark.svg" class="dark-bg" alt="Baseline newly available icon dark"><br>
      <a href="assets/img/baseline-newly-icon-dark.png" download>Download PNG</a> |
      <a href="assets/img/baseline-newly-icon-dark.svg" download>Download SVG</a>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <img src="assets/img/baseline-newly-word.svg" alt="Baseline newly available wordmark"><br>
      <a href="assets/img/baseline-newly-word.png" download>Download PNG</a> |
      <a href="assets/img/baseline-newly-word.svg" download>Download SVG</a>
    </td>
    <td>
      <img src="assets/img/baseline-newly-word-dark.svg" class="dark-bg" alt="Baseline newly available wordmark dark"><br>
      <a href="assets/img/baseline-newly-word-dark.png" download>Download PNG</a> |
      <a href="assets/img/baseline-newly-word-dark.svg" download>Download SVG</a>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

The Baseline Newly Available logo should only be used to indicate a web platform feature is supported by all of the core browsers, and is therefore interoperable, but not yet widely available.
