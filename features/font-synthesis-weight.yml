name: font-synthesis-weight
description: The `font-synthesis-weight` CSS property sets whether or not the browser should synthesize bold typefaces when they're missing from the font.
spec: https://drafts.csswg.org/css-fonts-4/#font-synthesis-weight
group: font-synthesis
compat_features:
  - css.properties.font-synthesis-weight
  - css.properties.font-synthesis-weight.auto
  - css.properties.font-synthesis-weight.none
  # The font-synthesis shorthand also allows disabling all synthesis and opting
  # in to specific kinds of synthesis. As such, `font-synthesis: weight` affects
  # everything except weight, and doesn't fit the description of this feature.
  # See https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/1641.
