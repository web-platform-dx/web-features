name: color-scheme
description: The `color-scheme` CSS property sets which color schemes (light or dark) an element uses and may prevent automatic dark mode adjustments by the browser. The `prefers-color-scheme` media query detects the requested color scheme, and the `light-dark()` function accepts two colors and uses one depending on the current color scheme.
spec: https://drafts.csswg.org/css-color-adjust-1/#color-scheme-prop
# `color-scheme: only light` and `color-scheme: only dark` can be used to opt
# out from Chrome's Auto Dark Theme:
# https://developer.chrome.com/blog/auto-dark-theme/#detecting-auto-dark-theme
#
# Including them increases the Baseline low date from 2022-01-11 (Firefox 98) to
# 2022-02-03 (Chrome 98). Since this is less than a month's difference and the
# opt-out could be important for some developers, the later date is accepted.
