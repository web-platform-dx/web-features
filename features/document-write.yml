name: document.write()
description: The `document.open()`, `document.write()`, `document.writeln()`, and `document.close()` methods write content to a document, possibly while that document is still loading.
spec: https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/dynamic-markup-insertion.html
discouraged:
  # The spec doesn't actually discourage against open and close, but these methods are
  # really only useful for writing anyway, so we're marking the whole feature as discouraged.
