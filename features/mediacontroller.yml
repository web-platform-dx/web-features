  # No real alternative to point people to.
  # The main alternative is really "do it yourself" in practice: monitor playback
  # across your sources and adjust the playback rate individually as needed to
  # keep things in sync.
  # Work was done on this in the (now closed) Multi-Device Timing CG, linked to
  # the Timing Object spec proposal (which did not get much traction, hence the
  # closure): https://webtiming.github.io/timingobject/.
  # The timingsrc library (https://webtiming.github.io/timingsrc/) provides a
  # polyfill and works very well across browsers.
