name: Viewport units
description: The `vw`, `vh`, `vmin`, and `vmax` CSS viewport units are relative to the size of the viewport, and are used to size elements in relation to the viewport's dimensions.
# This feature excludes `vb` and `vi` because they were introduced later (see `viewport-relative-unit-variants`)
