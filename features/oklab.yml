name: Oklab and Oklch
description: "The Oklab color space expresses colors in terms of lightness and how red/green and blue/yellow a color is, aiming to match how humans perceive colors. Oklch is a variant of Oklab with polar coordinates. These color spaces can be used with the CSS `color()`, `oklab()`, and `oklch()` functions."

# TODO: The behavior of lightness gradients requiring gamut mapping is a
# topic of debate, and at least these browser bugs:
# https://crbug.com/329106317
# https://webkit.org/b/255939
# These problems should be captured in notes when we support notes.
# Editorial override has been applied to ignore mixed_type_parameters.
