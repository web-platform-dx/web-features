name: Notifications from service workers and installed apps
# This feature is for the platform-specific nature of notifications support
# in Chrome Android and Safari iOS, and anchors to the Caniuse feature.
#
# See `features/notifications.yml` for the full Notifications feature, which
# does not align with Caniuse.
description: Notifications via service worker registration's `showNotification()` method, sent from installed web applications (for example, saved to the Home Screen on Safari for iOS), show a message to the user, typically using the notification system of the host operating system.
