description: Mouse events, such as `click`, `mousedown`, or `mousemove`, fire when users interact with an input or pointing device such as a mouse, trackpad, or touchscreen.

# TODO: With the exception of mouseenter and mouseleave, it's likely that the
# mouse events were supported from the initial release in each browser. It'd be
# nice to research the data to be sure and fix it.
