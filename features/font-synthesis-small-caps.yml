name: font-synthesis-small-caps
description: "The `font-synthesis-small-caps` CSS property sets whether or not the browser should synthesize small caps typefaces when they're missing from the font."
spec: https://drafts.csswg.org/css-fonts-4/#font-synthesis-small-caps
group: font-synthesis
# The font-synthesis shorthand also allows disabling all synthesis and opting
# in to specific kinds of synthesis. As such, `font-synthesis: small-caps`
# affects everything except small caps, and doesn't fit the description of
# this feature. See https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/1641.
