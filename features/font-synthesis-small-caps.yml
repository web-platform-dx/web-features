  - css.properties.font-synthesis-small-caps.auto

  # The font-synthesis shorthand also allows disabling all synthesis and opting
  # in to specific kinds of synthesis. As such, `font-synthesis: small-caps`
  # affects everything except small caps, and doesn't fit the description of
  # this feature. See https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/1641.
