name: getYear() and setYear()
description: The `getYear()` and `setYear()` methods of `Date` objects get and set the year as an offset to 1900.
spec: https://tc39.es/ecma262/multipage/additional-ecmascript-features-for-web-browsers.html#sec-date.prototype.getyear
group: javascript
discouraged:
  reason: The `getYear()` and `setYear()` methods use a truncated number instead of the actual year number, known as a year 2000 problem.

  # No `alternatives` because it would be `alternatives: [date]`. In the future
  # it'd be nice to have an internal reference to getFullYear() and
  # setFullYear() instead.
