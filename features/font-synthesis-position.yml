description: "The `font-synthesis-position` CSS property sets whether or not the browser should synthesize subscript and superscript typefaces when they're missing from the font."
spec: https://drafts.csswg.org/css-fonts-4/#font-synthesis-position
group: font-synthesis
# The font-synthesis shorthand also allows disabling all synthesis and opting
# in to specific kinds of synthesis. As such, `font-synthesis: position`
# affects everything except position, and doesn't fit the description of this
# feature. See https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/1641.
