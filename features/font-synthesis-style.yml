name: font-synthesis-style
description: The `font-synthesis-style` CSS property sets whether or not the browser should synthesize italic and oblique typefaces when they're missing from the font.
spec: https://drafts.csswg.org/css-fonts-4/#font-synthesis-style
group: font-synthesis
# The font-synthesis shorthand also allows disabling all synthesis and opting
# in to specific kinds of synthesis. As such, `font-synthesis: style` affects
# everything except style, and doesn't fit the description of this feature.
# See https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/1641.
