# The initial support for WebVTT was fairly minimal. The VTTCue API isn't the
# main entry point to using WebVTT (<track src=captions.vtt> is) but can still
# be used to compute the status. It matches https://caniuse.com/webvtt other
# than the Safari iOS version. TODO: Research whether WebVTT was shipped in
# iOS 6, 7, or 8, and align all sources on the right answer.
