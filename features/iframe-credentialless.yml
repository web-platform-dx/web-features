name: Credentialless iframes
description: The `credentialless` attribute for the `<iframe>` HTML element loads third-party content in an ephemeral context and does not send any credentials such as cookies. When using cross-origin isolation, this allows you to embed content that does not send `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy` headers.
