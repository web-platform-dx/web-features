name: Speech recognition grammar
description: "The `SpeechRecognition.grammars` property of the Web Speech API represents a set of words or patterns of words that the recognition service should recognize, used for when the recognition service's accuracy is low."
spec: https://webaudio.github.io/web-speech-api/#speechreco-section
discouraged:
  # SpeechGrammar and SpeechGrammarList have been removed from the Web Speech API spec.
  # There is no alternative API to point to because speech recognition has improved
  # significantly, removing the need for grammar-based recognition.
  reason: Advancements in speech recognition mean that speech grammars are not needed to achieve low error rates.
