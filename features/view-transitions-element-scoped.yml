name: Element-scoped view transitions
description: >
  The `startViewTransition()` method of an `Element` object starts a view transition that affects only that element's DOM tree.
  The `contain: view-transition` CSS declaration contains the layout of the tree to be transitioned.
spec: https://github.com/WICG/view-transitions/blob/main/scoped-transitions.md
group: view-transitions
# Expecting:
# compat_features:
#  - api.Element.startViewTransitions
#  - css.properties.contain.view-transition
# This feature is subordinate to view-transitions. It should probably merge into
# it one day.
