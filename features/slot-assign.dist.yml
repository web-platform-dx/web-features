name: Imperative slot assignment
description: The `assign()` method for `<slot>` elements assigns nodes to the slot, as an alternative to using the `slot` and `name` HTML attributes. The nodes must be children of a shadow host and the shadow root must be created with the `slotAssignment` set to "manual". Also known as manual slot assignment.
