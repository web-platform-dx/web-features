name: <permission>
description: The `<permission>` HTML element shows a button that triggers a permission request, while the `HTMLInputElement` interface's `setConstraint()` method configures it. For example, clicking a `<permission type="microphone">` element asks the user to grant permission to record audio. Also known as Page Embedded Permission Control.
