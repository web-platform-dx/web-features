name: overlay
description: The `overlay` CSS property, used as an `allow-discrete` CSS transition, prevents a top layer element, such as a popover or a `<dialog>`, from being removed from the top layer before it has finished animating. You can't set the value of the `overlay` property; only use it as transition property.
