name: Unsanitized HTML parsing methods
description: The `Document.parseHTMLUnsafe()` static method parses HTML into a DOM tree, while the `setHTMLUnsafe()` method of `Element` and `ShadowRoot` parses and inserts HTML into an existing tree. No sanitization applies to these methods, so never call them with user-provided HTML strings.
