description: >
  The `scroll-target-group` CSS property sets the container where anchor links act as scroll markers.
  Using selectors such as `:target-current`, you can style elements when a target has scrolled into view.
  It's an alternative to the `::scroll-marker-group` pseudo-element, which generates scroll markers.
