# TODO: Sort out support with https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data/issues/24528
# Support for Relative colors in Chromium 119, Safari 16.4, Firefox 128.
# Support for currentColor in relative colors in Chromium 131, Safari 16.4, Firefox 133.
# We don't need separate features, but should pin the feature on one of those.
compat_features:
  # These are the only two features that don't use partial implementation for
  # some browser, so they can represent initial support for the feature.
