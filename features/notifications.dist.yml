name: Notifications
description: The notifications API sends system notifications to the user, often even when the page or browser is not the foreground application.

# Notifications support is complicated and this entry is unusual. It represents
# some kind of notification support available to web pages. More fine-grained
# features could be added to represent specific things that work.
#
# https://caniuse.com/notifications marks iOS support as partial with this note:
# "Requires website to first be added to the Home Screen."
#
# BCD doesn't use partial_implementation for safari_ios, but has this note:
# "Notifications are supported in web apps saved to the home screen."
#
# We do not have the concept of partial support or notes:
# https://github.com/web-platform-dx/web-features/issues/915
#
# Another complication is the two entry points to this API:
# - new Notification() for non-persistent notifications.
# - showNotification() in service workers for persistent notifications.
#
# Finally, BCD and caniuse.com disagree about whether it was Safari 6 or 7 that
# first supported notifications, and BCD originally agreed with caniuse.com:
# https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data/pull/7949
#
# Due to this complexity, manually combine these 3 data points:
# https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Notification/Notification#browser_compatibility
# https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ServiceWorkerRegistration/showNotification#browser_compatibility
# https://caniuse.com/notifications (excluding partial support on iOS)
