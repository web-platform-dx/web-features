name: Range syntax for style queries
description: The `@container style()` CSS at-rule and `if(style())` CSS function queries accept a range syntax, such as `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, to query for inexact values.
spec: https://drafts.csswg.org/css-conditional-5/#typedef-style-range
group: container-queries
# expected compat_features:
#  - css.types.if.style.range_syntax
#  - css.at-rules.container.style_queries_for_custom_properties.range_syntax
# This is a bit of an oddity, where someday this feature will split in two,
# merging its constituent parts into `container-style-queries` and `if`.
