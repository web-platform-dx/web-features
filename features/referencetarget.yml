name: Reference target
description: The `referenceTarget` property of a `ShadowRoot` object forwards attributes such as `for` and `aria-labelledby` to elements inside a shadow DOM. This allows, for example, to link a `<label>` to its `<input>` even if the `<input>` is in the shadow DOM of a web component.
