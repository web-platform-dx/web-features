# BCD considers Web Bluetooth partially supported in Chrome due to the lack of
# support on Linux (per guidelines), but caniuse makes this a regular note:
# https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data/blob/77452e99e130d783418b3fe1bd1862a558d911bb/api/Bluetooth.json#L13-L15
# https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data/blob/77452e99e130d783418b3fe1bd1862a558d911bb/docs/data-guidelines/index.md#operating-system-limitations-imply-partial_implementation
# https://caniuse.com/web-bluetooth
#
# Nevertheless, it seems fair to call the features supported since Chrome 70,
# since macOS and Windows account for the vast majority of users. This ends up
# in-between the BCD and caniuse statuses, aligning with neither.
#
# TODO: convert this to partial implementation with notes.
