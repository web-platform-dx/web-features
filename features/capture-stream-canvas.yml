name: captureStream() for <canvas>
description: The `captureStream()` method for `<canvas>` elements returns a `MediaStream` which includes a `CanvasCaptureMediaStreamTrack` representing real-time video of the canvas image. You can use this to record the canvas, or send it elsewhere, such as another canvas or WebRTC connection.
# TODO: Firefox implements `CanvasCaptureMediaStream` as an equivalent to `CanvasCaptureMediaStreamTrack`.
#
# Add a note when https://github.com/web-platform-dx/web-features/issues/915 is resolved.
