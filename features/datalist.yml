# BCD and caniuse use partial support differently for <datalist>. The versions
# below were picked as the lowest versions where both agree the feature is fully
# supported, with the single exception of Firefox, which BCD treats as partially
# support due to it not working for all input types.
# TODO: Align BCD and caniuse and use partial support with notes to match here.
