# TODO: This feature should ideally be in highlight.yml, but was split out of it because support
# is more recent than the rest of the parent feature.
# Over time, it will make sense to merge it back into highlight.yml.
# Also, see https://github.com/web-platform-dx/web-features/issues/2676 for a discussion about
# the ability to reference sub-features that are part of a larger feature.
