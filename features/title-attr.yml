name: title (attribute)
description: The `title` global HTML attribute sets information about an element, such as a name or description. The value is typically shown as a tooltip that appears on mouse over. Since it's not often available to touch-only, keyboard-only, or assistive technology users, it's not a substitute for other text.
spec: https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/dom.html#attr-title
# Don't mark this feature as discouraged. The specification note narrowly
# discourages certain kinds of uses for title, but not the attribute in general.
