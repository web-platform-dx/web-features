description: The `with` JavaScript statement adds a given object to the chain of scopes used to evaluate names.
spec: https://tc39.es/ecma262/multipage/ecmascript-language-statements-and-declarations.html#sec-with-statement
group: javascript
discouraged:
  # One thing that is potentially missing here is a "reason" like this:

  # reason: browser-warning
  # reason: spec-caution
  # reason: pending-removal

  # This would allow us to signal to tools how "fatal" the discouragement is
  # (e.g., pending-removal should trigger noisy errors for developers but spec
  # caution would not). I'm not sure the full range of these yet; I think it
  # might be easier to choose the set of reasons after we've enumerated a bunch
  # of discouraged features.
