# Draft features

This directory is for draft features which are not yet ready to be published as
part of web-features. Draft features can be used for:

- Features where the specification is not yet complete.
- Features that have not yet shipped in any browser.
- Definitions that need further editorial review, and are made available as
  drafts as a way to invite contributions through such review.

Draft features must have a `draft_date` field, and draft features more than 1
year old with no sign of progress may be deleted.
