name: FormDataEvent
description: The FormDataEvent interface represents a formdata event — such an event is fired on an HTMLFormElement object after the entry list representing the form&#x27;s data is constructed. This happens when the form is submitted, but can also be triggered by the invocation of a FormData() constructor.
