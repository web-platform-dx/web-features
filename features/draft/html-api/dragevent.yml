name: DragEvent
description: The DragEvent interface is a DOM event that represents a drag and drop interaction. The user initiates a drag by placing a pointer device (such as a mouse) on the touch surface and then dragging the pointer to a new location (such as another DOM element). Applications are free to interpret a drag and drop interaction in an application-specific way.
