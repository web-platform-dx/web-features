# This group isn't intended for everything defined in HTML:
# spec: https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/
#
# It is for the markup language, and not for all APIs and infrastructure
# defined in HTML. For example, structuredClone() should not be in this group.
# APIs on HTML*Element and CSS features specific to an HTML element generally
# do make sense to group under HTML, however.
