# [`compute-baseline`](https://github.com/web-platform-dx/web-features/)

By the [W3C WebDX Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/webdx/) and contributors.

`compute-baseline` computes preliminary [Baseline statuses](https://github.com/web-platform-dx/web-features/blob/main/docs/baseline.md) from `@mdn/browser-compat-data` feature keys.
You can use `compute-baseline` to help you find interopable web platform features, propose new [`web-features`](https://github.com/web-platform-dx/web-features/) features, or compare support between features.

`compute-baseline` also provides utility classes for working with `@mdn/browser-compat-data` generally.

## Limitations

If you need authoritative Baseline statuses, check out the [`web-features`](https://github.com/web-platform-dx/web-features/tree/main/packages/web-features) package instead.

Don't use `compute-baseline` to generate publishable Baseline statuses for arbitrary web platform features.
The results of `compute-baseline` invocations have _not_ received editorial review.
Strictly speaking, a Baseline status requires editorial review, so statuses generated by `compute-baseline` are tentative.
If you need authoritative Baseline statuses, check out the [`web-features`](https://github.com/web-platform-dx/web-features/tree/main/packages/web-features) package instead.

You can use `compute-baseline` to explore possibilities or do error correction.
For example, you might use `compute-baseline` to hide a Baseline status, when showing a broader feature's status might be misleading.

If you're not sure whether your application fits with the definition of Baseline, please [file an issue](https://github.com/web-platform-dx/web-features/issues/new).

## Prerequisites

To use this package, you'll need:

- Node.js (a supported [current, active LTS, or maintenance LTS release](https://nodejs.org/en/about/previous-releases))

## Install

To install the package, run:

`npm install --save compute-baseline`

If you wish to specify which version of `@mdn/browser-compat-data` (or manage its upgrades explicitly, such as with Dependabot), then install the latest `@mdn/browser-compat-data` too.
Run:

`npm install --save @mdn/browser-compat-data@latest`

## Usage

```javascript
import { computeBaseline } from "compute-baseline";

computeBaseline({
  compatKeys: ["css.properties.border-color"],
  checkAncestors: false,
});
```
