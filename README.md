# [`web-features`](https://github.com/web-platform-dx/web-features): exploring the set of interoperable features of the web platform

By the [W3C WebDX Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/webdx/) and contributors.

`web-features` is an effort to build a shared catalog of features of the web platform.
By creating a common list of features and their definitions, `web-features` aims to improve understanding of what web developers get and want from the web.
`web-features` does this by:

- Creating feature definitions, which identify and describe capabilities of the web
- Generating [_Baseline_](./docs/baseline.md) support data, which summarizes the availability of web features across key browsers and releases
- Publishing the `web-features` npm package, which bundles feature identifiers with Baseline statuses

From `Array` to Cascade Layers to Offscreen Canvas, `web-features` identifies, defines, and categorizes capabilities of the web platform that web developers care about.
By creating a common nomenclature for web platform features, `web-features` intends to support communication between web developers, browser vendors, standardization bodies, and other ecosystem participants.

## Get started

To get feature identifiers, Baseline support data, or cross-references to other resources (such as specifications and caniuse), use [the `web-features` npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/web-features).
[Read the package README](./packages/web-features/README.md) for more information.

To contribute to feature identification, definition, Baseline support statuses, or to update the status on MDN, jump to [Contribute](#contribute).
