# Override is needed to fix the Edge version:
# https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data/pull/22913
#
# Firefox support for `enumerateDevices()` also needs an override since lack of
# output device (a separate feature) is treated as partial implementation in
# BCD.

# This is a reasonable but incomplete subset of basic media capture, but
