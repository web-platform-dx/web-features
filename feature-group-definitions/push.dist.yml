# https://caniuse.com/push-api marks iOS support as partial with this note:
# "Requires website to first be added to the Home Screen. Delivered silently,
# meaning no sound, vibration, haptics or screen wake."
#
# BCD doesn't use partial_implementation for safari_ios, but has this note:
# "Notifications are supported in web apps saved to the home screen."
#
# We do not have the concept of partial support or notes:

# TODO: Revisit this entry and consider matching caniuse.com if that matches
# developer expectations, or otherwise align BCD, caniuse, and web-features.
