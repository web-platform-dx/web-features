name: Lab and LCH
description: "The CIE Lab color space expresses colors in terms of lightness and how red/green and blue/yellow a color is. LCH is a variant of Lab with polar coordinates. These color spaces can be used with the CSS `color()`, `lab()`, and `lch()` functions. Also known as CIELAB and CIELCH."

# Editorial override has been applied to ignore mixed_type_parameters.
# TODO: The behavior of lightness gradients requiring gamut mapping is a
# topic of debate, and at least these browser bugs:
# https://crbug.com/329106317
# https://webkit.org/b/255939
# These problems should be captured in notes when we support notes.
