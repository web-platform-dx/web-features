# MathML has evolved for more than 20 years and computing its status from BCD is
# challenging. To represent basic support for MathML, the following statuses
# match the earliest support claimed by caniuse.com or BCD:
# https://caniuse.com/mathml
# https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/MathML/Element/math
#
# Note that there are minor disagreements between sources about initial support
# in different browsers. Where either source claims partial support, the
# versions were increased. Following this method, Firefox was increased due to
# BCD, and Safari due to caniuse.com.
#
# TODO: Partial support in Firefox <4 and Safari <10, with notes.
