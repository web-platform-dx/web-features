compat_features:

  - css.properties.font-synthesis-weight.auto
  - css.properties.font-synthesis-weight.none
  # The font-synthesis shorthand also allows disabling all synthesis and opting
  # in to specific kinds of synthesis. As such, `font-synthesis: weight` affects
  # everything except weight, and doesn't fit the description of this feature.
