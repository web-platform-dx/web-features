  # The messageerror event seems to not fire on ServiceWorkerGlobalScope in
  # WebKit. This is an important part of the feature, but it's not crystal clear
  # if it might fire under some conditions. TODO: Revisit this when
  # https://webkit.org/b/272967 has been resolved or has comments.

  - api.Window.messageerror_event
  # The messageerror event can only fire on Worker in rare conditions such as
  # going out-of-memory and the onmessageerror property is missing in Blink:
