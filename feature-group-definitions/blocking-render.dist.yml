description: 'The blocking="render" attribute for <link>, <script>, and <style> elements blocks rendering until the external script or stylesheet has been loaded. For <link rel="expect">, rendering is blocked until a specific element is in the DOM.'
# A few additional "limitations" that aren't in the description but could potentially be:
#  - Rendering is not blocked indefinitely, there are UA-defined timeouts
#  - Only works for text/html documents
#  - Only works in <head>
#  - Doesn't work on non-async classic scripts
#  - Only works for on <link rel=stylesheet> and <link rel=expect>, not other <link>s
