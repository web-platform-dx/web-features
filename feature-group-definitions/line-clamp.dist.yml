description: "The `line-clamp` CSS property limits the text in a block container to a certain number of lines. The prefixed `-webkit-line-clamp` is widely supported but only works with `-webkit-box-orient: vertical` in combination with `display: -webkit-box` or `display: -webkit-inline-box`."

# Since BCD has an entry for -webkit-line-clamp but none for unprefixed
# line-clamp, we need an override to represent that no browser supports this. If
# https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data/pull/22951 is merged, this can be
# removed:
